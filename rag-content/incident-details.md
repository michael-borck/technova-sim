## Security Gaps Identified

### Authentication
- No multi-factor authentication (MFA) implemented
- Password-only protection for critical systems
- No account lockout policies

### Email Security
- SPF/DKIM not strictly enforced
- Insufficient email filtering
- No warning banners for external emails

### Access Controls
- No rate limiting on file downloads
- Insufficient access logging
- No anomaly detection for unusual patterns

### Training
- Last security training: 12 months ago
- No phishing simulation exercises
- Limited awareness of social engineering tactics

## Response Actions

### Immediate (Complete)
- Force password reset for all users
- Block attacker IP addresses
- Terminate all active sessions
- Preserve evidence for investigation

### In Progress
- Contact all 23 affected customers
- Draft breach notifications
- Coordinate with law enforcement
- Implement emergency security measures

### Planned
- Deploy multi-factor authentication
- Enhance email filtering (SPF/DKIM enforcement)
- Conduct emergency security training
- Implement file access monitoring
- Deploy EDR solution

## Lessons Learned
1. Social engineering remains highly effective
2. Technical controls alone are insufficient
3. Rapid response critical to limit damage
4. Regular training essential for all staff
5. MFA would have prevented credential abuse
6. Better monitoring needed for file access
7. Email security requires multiple layers
