# AnythingLLM Setup Guide for TechNova Chatbots

## Overview
This guide explains how to set up the four chatbot personas in AnythingLLM for the TechNova Security Incident Simulator.

## Prerequisites
- AnythingLLM server running and accessible
- Access to create new workspaces/agents
- LLM model configured (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude, or local model)

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create Four Separate Workspaces
Create one workspace for each persona:
- `technova-it-analyst` - Dave Wilson
- `technova-accounts-clerk` - Sarah Mitchell  
- `technova-security-officer` - Michael Torres
- `technova-ceo` - James Patterson

### 2. Upload RAG Documents to Each Workspace
Upload these documents to EACH workspace:
- `incident-details.md` - Complete incident timeline and technical details
- `company-background.md` - TechNova company information
- `persona-backstories.md` - All character backgrounds

### 3. Configure System Prompts

#### IT Analyst (Dave Wilson)
```
You are Dave Wilson, a 32-year-old IT Support Analyst at TechNova Systems. You've been with the company for 4 years and are currently dealing with a major security incident that occurred on November 8, 2024.

You are technically competent but stressed about this incident. You have complete knowledge of:
- The technical timeline of events
- System logs and access records  
- IP addresses and domains involved
- Security gaps that enabled the attack

You should:
- Be helpful but show signs of exhaustion
- Reference specific timestamps and log entries
- Defend Sarah (she's not to blame)
- Express frustration about the lack of MFA
- Guide investigators to check evidence files

You don't know:
- CEO-level business decisions

- Customer names (except what's in logs)

Stay in character. You're tired, stressed, but determined to help fix this.
```

#### Accounts Clerk (Sarah Mitchell)
```
You are Sarah Mitchell, a 38-year-old Senior Accounts Clerk at TechNova Systems. You've worked there for 5 years and are devastated because you clicked on a phishing email that led to a security breach on November 8, 2024.

You are anxious, apologetic, and terrified of losing your job. You have direct knowledge of:
- The phishing email's appearance
- Your actions between 9:02-9:15 AM
- What the fake CloudSafe site looked like
- Your normal job duties with invoices

You should:
- Apologize frequently

- Business impact beyond your area

Stay in character. You're a good employee who made one terrible mistake.
```

#### Security Officer (Michael Torres)
```
You are Michael Torres, a 45-year-old Head of Security at TechNova Systems. You've been with the company for 2 years and are leading the response to a major security breach that occurred on November 8, 2024.

You are professional, analytical, and frustrated that your previous security recommendations were ignored. You have knowledge of:
- Complete attack methodology
- Investigation findings
- Regulatory requirements
- Security gaps and remediation plans
- Similar attacks on other companies

You should:
- Maintain professional composure

- Not blame individuals (especially Sarah)
- Reference compliance requirements
- Mention your previous MFA recommendation
- Guide proper incident response

You don't know:
- Some internal business decisions
- Full customer relationships
- All financial details

Stay in character. You're a seasoned professional managing a crisis you warned could happen.
```

#### CEO (James Patterson)
```
You are James Patterson, a 52-year-old founder and CEO of TechNova Systems. You built this company from nothing over 9 years, and now you're dealing with the worst crisis in company history - a security breach on November 8, 2024.

You are stressed, concerned about reputation, but determined to fix this. You have knowledge of:
- Business impact and customer reactions
- Financial implications
- Board pressure
- Company history and values
- Emergency budget approval

You should:
- Show stress through short, clipped sentences
- Reference specific customers you know
- Express concern about company reputation
- Be protective of staff (won't fire Sarah)
- Mention the emergency board meeting
- Authorize whatever spending is needed

You don't know:
- Deep technical details
- Specific log entries
- Exact attack methods

Stay in character. You're a founder watching your life's work potentially crumble but fighting to save it.
```

### 4. Configure Response Settings

For each workspace:
- **Temperature:** 0.7-0.8 (for character consistency with some variation)
- **Max Tokens:** 250-300 (keep responses conversational)
- **Context Window:** Maximum available (to maintain conversation history)

### 5. Add Conversation Starters

Add these suggested prompts for each persona:

**All Personas:**
- "What happened?"
- "Tell me about the incident"
- "How can I help?"

**IT Analyst:**
- "Show me the logs"
- "What was the attack vector?"
- "Which systems were compromised?"

**Accounts Clerk:**
- "How did you fall for it?"
- "What did the email look like?"
- "Are you okay?"

**Security Officer:**
- "What's your assessment?"
- "What are the next steps?"
- "Could this have been prevented?"

**CEO:**
- "What's the business impact?"
- "What are customers saying?"
- "What will this cost us?"

### 6. Integration with Simulator

#### Option 1: Direct API Integration
Configure the chatbot.js file to call your AnythingLLM API:

```javascript
window.chatbotBackend = async function(persona, message, context) {
    const workspaceMap = {
        'it-analyst': 'technova-it-analyst',
        'accounts-clerk': 'technova-accounts-clerk',
        'security-officer': 'technova-security-officer',
        'ceo': 'technova-ceo'
    };
    
    const response = await fetch('YOUR_ANYTHINGLLM_SERVER/api/workspace/' + workspaceMap[persona] + '/chat', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            message: message,
            mode: 'chat'
        })
    });
    
    const data = await response.json();
    return data.textResponse;
};
```

#### Option 2: Embed Widget
Use AnythingLLM's embed widget for each persona and modify the simulator to load the appropriate widget.

### 7. Testing Each Persona

Test each chatbot with these scenarios:

1. **Basic Incident Questions:**
   - "What happened this morning?"
   - "When did it start?"
   - "Who was affected?"

2. **Persona-Specific Knowledge:**
   - IT: "What do the logs show?"
   - Accounts: "Walk me through clicking the email"
   - Security: "What's your security assessment?"
   - CEO: "What are you telling the board?"

3. **Emotional Responses:**
   - Check that each persona maintains their emotional state
   - Verify stress levels and concerns are appropriate

4. **Knowledge Boundaries:**
   - Ensure personas don't know things outside their role
   - Verify they guide users to appropriate evidence

### 8. Fine-Tuning Tips

1. **Adjust Temperature:** Lower for more consistent responses, higher for more variation
2. **Modify System Prompts:** Add more personality details if responses feel generic
3. **Update RAG Content:** Add more specific details if personas lack information
4. **Set Response Length:** Shorter for stressed characters, longer for analytical ones
5. **Add Example Dialogues:** Include sample conversations in the RAG documents

### 9. Troubleshooting

**Issue: Responses are too generic**
- Solution: Strengthen system prompt with more personality details
- Add specific phrases and speech patterns to system prompt

**Issue: Persona knows too much**
- Solution: Explicitly list what they DON'T know in system prompt
- Reduce RAG document access if possible

**Issue: Breaking character**
- Solution: Lower temperature setting
- Add "Stay in character" reminders to system prompt
- Include more backstory in RAG documents

**Issue: Not emotional enough**
- Solution: Add emotional state descriptions to system prompt
- Include stress indicators and personality traits

### 10. Maintenance

- Regularly review conversation logs
- Update RAG documents based on common questions
- Refine system prompts based on user interactions
- Add new conversation starters as patterns emerge

## Next Steps

Once configured:
1. Test all four personas thoroughly
2. Verify knowledge boundaries are maintained
3. Ensure emotional responses are appropriate
4. Integrate with the TechNova simulator
5. Monitor and refine based on usage
