                <p><strong>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA</strong> â€“ TechNova Systems is currently investigating an incident affecting a small number of customer communications. Our core systems and infrastructure remain fully operational and secure.</p>
                
                <p>We have identified instances where <em>payment details may have been altered in customer communications</em>. This appears to be limited to a subset of invoice communications sent to customers over the past 48 hours.</p>
                
                <h2>What We Know</h2>
                <p>Our security team has identified that some customer invoices may contain bank account information that differs from our standard payment details. We are actively investigating the root cause of this issue and have taken immediate steps to prevent any further occurrences.</p>
                
                <h2>Customer Impact</h2>
                <p>We estimate that fewer than 30 customers may have received affected communications. We are in the process of contacting all potentially impacted customers directly.</p>
                
                <h2>What Customers Should Do</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you have recently received an invoice with updated bank details, please do not process payment</li>
                    <li>Contact our support team immediately at 1300 TECHNOVA to verify any payment information</li>
                    <li>Check our <a href="faq.html">Customer FAQ</a> for additional guidance</li>
