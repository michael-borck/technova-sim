                <p>Our legitimate bank details have not changed and are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bank: Commonwealth Bank of Australia</li>

                <h3>Q: How do I know if an email from TechNova is legitimate?</h3>
                <p>All official TechNova emails come from addresses ending in <strong>@technova.example</strong>. Be cautious of emails from similar-looking domains such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>@tecknova.com (missing 'h')</li>
                    <li>@technnova.com (extra 'n')</li>
                    <li>@technova-systems.com (hyphenated)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We will never ask you to update your password or payment details via email.</p>

                <h3>Q: I received an email about CloudSafe Backup renewal. Is this real?</h3>
                <p>CloudSafe renewal notices come directly from <strong>@cloudsafe.com</strong>, not from TechNova. If you received a renewal notice claiming to be from CloudSafe but with a different domain, it may be fraudulent.</p>
                <p>Legitimate CloudSafe emails will:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Come from noreply@cloudsafe.com</li>
                    <li>Include your account number</li>
                    <li>Never ask for passwords</li>
                    <li>Direct you to the official CloudSafe portal</li>

                <h3>Q: How can I verify a TechNova employee?</h3>
                <p>All TechNova employees have official email addresses and employee IDs. If someone claims to be from TechNova:</p>
                <ul>
