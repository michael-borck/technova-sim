## Key Features Implemented

### Evidence Trail
The incident follows this timeline:
1. 9:02 AM - Phishing email sent
2. 9:12 AM - Sarah clicks link, enters credentials
3. 9:26 AM - Customers report fake invoices
4. 10:01-10:15 AM - 23 invoices downloaded
5. 10:45 AM - Security team responds

### Clue System
- Homepage: Service notice → Press release
- Press: "payment details altered" → FAQ
- FAQ: Invoice comparison link → internal/invoices.html
- Staff Portal: Helpdesk updates → internal/helpdesk-log.html
- Helpdesk: Links to all evidence

### Chat System
- Floating button on all pages
- Four personas with distinct knowledge
- Fallback responses if no backend
- Window for custom integration: `window.chatbotBackend()`

## Integration Points

### For JavaScript Backend
The chatbot.js file looks for `window.chatbotBackend` function:
```javascript
window.chatbotBackend = async (persona, message, context) => {
    // Your implementation here
    return responseString;
}
```

Context includes:
- `persona`: 'it-analyst', 'accounts-clerk', 'security-officer', or 'ceo'
- `message`: User's question
- `context.page`: Current page path
- `context.sessionId`: Unique session identifier

## Ready for Testing
The simulation is functional with:
- Complete website navigation
- Evidence discovery path
- Basic chatbot with fallback responses
- Professional corporate appearance
- Mobile-responsive design

Students can already begin investigating the incident!
